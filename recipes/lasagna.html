  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna, featuring a rich, meaty tomato sauce from scratch and a cheesy filling. Instead of traditional ricotta, she uses a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan for a unique touch. I've never found a better lasagna! Pair it with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread for a perfect meal.</p>

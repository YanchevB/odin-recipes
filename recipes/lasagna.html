  <h1>Lasagna recipe</h1>
  <img src="../images/lasagna.jpg" alt="Deliciously cooked lasagna">

  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna, featuring a rich, meaty tomato sauce from scratch and a cheesy filling. Instead of traditional ricotta, she uses a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan for a unique touch. I've never found a better lasagna! Pair it with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread for a perfect meal.</p>

  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Meat</strong>: You will need a pound of ground meat (pork or beef).</li>
    <li><strong>Onion</strong>: 1 diced onion will do the trick.</li>
    <li><strong>Canned tomatoes</strong>: Any would do, just make sure you have enough for the tomato sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Fresh herbs</strong>: Fresh parsley and a clove of garlic.</li>
    <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: We can use a dash of sugar to balance out the acidity from the tomatoes, though it is not entirely necessary.</li>
    <li><strong>Spices and seasonings</strong>: The ones you need are dried basil, oregano, salt and black pepper.</li>
    <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>: Any type would do but you can use oven-ready as well.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Lots</em> of cheese</strong>: This recipe emphasizes on the use of cheese so feel free to use cottage cheese, parmesan and mozzarella.</li>
    <li><strong>Eggs</strong>: Using eggs will make the cheese layer extra creamy and will also hold together all of the layers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Cook the meat</strong>: To start off, we need to cook the ground beef (or whichever type of meat you chose) until it's browned and crumbly. Add the onion and cook until translucent. At this point, add the canned tomatoes and all of the spices and seasonings.</li>
    <li><strong>Cook the noodles</strong>: Boil the lasagna noodles in salted water until they are somewhat soft.</li>
    <li><strong>Make the cheese layer</strong>: Mix all of the cheeses together and the remaining spices and seasonings.</li>
    <li><strong>Lasagna, assemble</strong>: At this point, start layering the ingredients by starting with the sauce and ending with mozzarella.</li>
    <li><strong>Bake the lasagna</strong>: Cover with foil and bake in the oven for about half an hour at 200 degrees C.</li>
  </ol>
